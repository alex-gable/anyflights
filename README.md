# anyflights

This package, derived from `nycflights13`, includes functions to download information about all flights for user-specified airports and time frames. To help understand 
what causes delays, it also includes a number of other useful datasets:

* `weather`: hourly meteorological data for the airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport name and location
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

This package is in development. Beginning with functionality from `nycflights`, a package based on `nycflights13`, `anyflights` will include user functions to query and save datasets similar to that housed in both of these packages for user-specified airports and time-frames, but will not include any data itself.
