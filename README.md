# anyflights

This package, derived from `nycflights13`, includes functions to query datasets about air travel for user-specified airports and years.

* `flights`: all flights that departed a given airport in a given year
* `weather`: hourly meterological data for a given airport in a given year
* `planes`: construction information about relevant planes
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

Beginning with functionality from `nycflights13`, `anyflights` supplies a set of user functions to query and save datasets similar to that housed in `nycflights13` for user-specified airports and time-frames, but does not include any data itself.
